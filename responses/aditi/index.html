  <div class="message to">5 things you wish KMIT had</div>
  <div class="message from">A larger campus, a convocation ceremony, free Wi-Fi everywhere, the radio to be revived – trust me, I tried. pizza in the canteen. xD</div>
  <div class="message to">Favourite Adda on the campus</div>
  <div class="message from">The last benches in class – it’s the best spot, ever!</div>
  <div class="message to">Advice to 1st, 2nd, 3rd Year students</div>
  <div class="message from">Serious advice: Be nice to the profs. They’re really cool once you get to know them – and extremely helpful! Not-so-serious-advice: Ask that girl out. She’ll probably say yes!</div>
  <div class="message to">Things everyone should do in KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">Go up to the Radio room at least once! There is some real good equipment there. Also, start doing something about it, kids.</div>
  <div class="message to">Any fascinating person/people you’ve met at KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">Jayanth sir! He taught us one class on Python.. And after a few months, he met me near the R&D department. This was back in 1st year. He asked me why I chose engineering, to which I replied saying I had no choice, and it was the next best thing for me after my dreams of studying law didn’t materialize. He asked me to either develop an interest, or go do something else that I was passionate about. He was pretty loud when he exclaimed “WHAT?! Why would you do that to yourself? People like you should not pursure engineering!” I swear, the whole corridor looked at me weirdly. After that day, I was pretty sure I’d never forget him, or his advice.</div>
  <div class="message to">What will you miss about college life or being at KMIT?</div>
  <div class="message from">Definitely, all the fun stuff we used to do during class, in the back benches! Pretty sure we gave the profs a bit of a hard time! Also, I’ll miss my stint as a former Editor of kMitra, formerly Vipasana.</div>
  <div class="message to">Best experience at KMIT:</div>
  <div class="message from">I’m not one for bunking classes, but some of the best things I remember, are during the times we spent loitering near the library stairs, hiding from profs. In the blistering heat, we lazed around chatting about nothing and everything. Then, we panicked and started writing an assignment after someone came up to us and told us it was the last day of sumbmission. XD </div>
  <div class="message to">Where do you see KMIT 5 years from now?</div>
  <div class="message from">Expanding rapidly and extremely well known for its CSE courses. It’s already quite famous, and I’m sure it’ll easily become one of the best colleges in the state. </div>
  <div class="message to">5 things that only happen in KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">Getting caught while bunking classes, Patang Utsav – one of my favourite things about the college, having started a college magazine from scratch – and running it so perfectly over a short period of time. The lovely festivities like the Halloween fests and KMIT Evening.</div>
  <!-- <div class="message to"> What is the crowd like in KMIT?</div> -->
  <!-- <div class="message from">Blahblahblahblahblah</div> -->

  <!-- <div class="message from">Blahblahblahblahblah</div> -->
  <div class="message to">Favorite year in college</div>
  <div class="message from">3rd year – 1st semester! It was one of the best ever. We had a lot of fun, the lecturers very lenient, and we had quite a lot of free time.</div>
  <!-- <div class="message to">A funny moment in the class</div> -->
  <!-- <div class="message from">Blahblahblahblahblah</div> -->
  <div class="message to">When have you been punished and for what?</div>
