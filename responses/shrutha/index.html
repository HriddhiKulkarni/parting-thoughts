  <div class="message to">5 things you wish KMIT had</div>
  <div class="message from">I think KMIT is perfect but if I have to tell you 5 things then I’d say:<br>
  1. The canteen can have more variety of food items.<br>
  2. Wider range of books and anytime access to the internet in the library.<br>
  3. I wish we had a longer short break.<br>
  4. Different clubs like drama club, literary club, sports club, dance/singing/painting clubs, etc as KMITians are very talented and they can learn and improve themselves when they are in such clubs.<br>
  5. Our own college fest. We always wanted mirrors in the washrooms and finally in 4th year we got them so that’s good. </div>
  <div class="message to">Favourite Adda on the campus</div>
  <div class="message from">There used to be these benches behind the auditorium near the tennis court till we were in 2nd year, my friends and I used to sit there like all the time. We used to call that place “audi ke peeche”, anyway, there are no benches and we are not allowed to sit there anymore tongue emoticon We spend a lot of time in the canteen and the lawn outside the canteen as well.</div>
  <div class="message to">Advice to 1st, 2nd, 3rd Year students</div>
  <div class="message from">These 4 years are going to pass by so quickly that we won’t even realise it, study well, make friends, go out with your friends, be nice to everyone, learn new things, quit making excuses, learn from your mistakes, never give up, make your parents proud, have fun, make memories and take lots and lots of pictures!</div>

  <div class="message to">What will you miss about college life or being at KMIT?</div>
  <div class="message from">Everything. I love KMIT, I’ll miss our lecturers, our classrooms, our canteen, canteen food, my classmates, all my friends, my seniors and juniors I talk to in college. I’ll miss completing assignments, meeting deadlines, begging our lecturers to give us few more days to submit our assignments, asking them to give us a free period, trying to make them add atleast 1 or 2 marks after checking our internal papers, I’ll miss all the times we bunked college, having lunch with all my friends in my classroom, I’ll miss laughing, gossiping, teasing, studying,fighting,crying and then making up with my friends. I’ll miss those sleepovers where my friends and i used to plan on staying up the whole night to study one day before an exam but eventually falling asleep and then freaking out once we were up. </div>
  <div class="message to">Best experience at KMIT:</div>
  <div class="message from">The complete Tech Mahindra recruitment process was an amazing experience, first the aptitude,verbal and logical round,then writing an essay on women empowerment, then the technical round followed by the HR round and then waiting for the result. The complete process was very memorable and was one of my best experiences at KMIT. Also we gave a classical dance performance when Mrs. Smriti Irani ( minister of Human Resource Development ) had visited our college last year, that was a memorable experience too.</div>

  <div class="message from">Expansive, Inclusive, and inspirational (with extremely talented people like Mr. Neil Gogte, Mr.lathkar, Mr. Sudheer Reddy, Ms. Shweta Paropkari teaching and guiding us)</div>
  <div class="message to">What did you do for the last time in KMIT?/What is your best last memory?</div>
  <div class="message from">As I am an Ece student, we are working on our final year major projects in college right now, my best last memory would be of my group and I, trying to figure out how to build the robot that we are making right now, then working on the model and finally making it work, and how we felt when it actually worked is something I’ll never forget.</div>
  <div class="message to">Favorite year in college</div>
  <div class="message from">1st year. It was amazing!!! My first year was actually damn nice, I didn’t like college at all, for 1-2 weeks, every single day, I used to cry as soon as I got home from college. But then things changed, I made amazing friends, every day we used to sit outside the canteen, in the lawn till 5:30-6 in the evening and talk about so many things. Things got pretty strict from the next year though, we weren’t allowed to sit in the lawn for so long.</div>
  <div class="message to">A funny moment in the class</div>
  <div class="message from">There was this one time when our mam was teaching us and there was a lizard behind the white board. I freaked out as soon as I saw that lizard. I was trying to tell my mam that there was a lizard there, my classmates laughed so hard. It wasn’t that funny then but now when I think of it, it’s damn funny.</div>
  <div class="message to">When have you been punished and for what?</div>
  <div class="message from">In first year, our M1 sir would give us homework almost everyday, we had to solve around 10-15 sums in our notebook, he would check our homework the next day and whoever didn’t finish it were supposed to stand at the back of the class or sometimes were sent out of the class. There were few times I didn’t finish the work and was asked to get out of the class or stand behind. I miss M1 classes now </div>
