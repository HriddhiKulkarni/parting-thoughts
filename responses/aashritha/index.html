  <div class="message to">5 things you wish KMIT had</div>
  <div class="message from">
    1.College fest<br>
    2. WiFi enabled campus<br>
    3. Graduation ceremony<br>
    4. Student clubs<br>
    5. Better website :P
  </div>
  <div class="message to">Favourite Adda on the campus</div>
  <div class="message from">Well, there isn’t much choice but it has to be the canteen as we’ve spent most of our time there.</div>
  <div class="message to">Advice to 1st, 2nd, 3rd Year students</div>
  <div class="message from">
    Not much advice for 1st years, just have fun, make friends and cherish every moment because you will never get that kind of time and opportunity again. These are the memories that stay with you forever so make the best of it. “A little nerd alert here” 2nd year is when we all become seniors and I agree that is a nice feeling but it’s also the year where we have the most boring and difficult subjects to pass so I would advise to get a little serious about attending classes. Apart from that I suggest you guys attend other college fests too not just because we don’t have one but because it’s really fun and gives a lot of exposure.<br>
    I don’t think 3rd years would really need any advice because they have everything figured out or at least they think they do. So I would only ask them to never give up and pursue something they are passionate about. I know that balancing between FS classes and Jntu can be very challenging and nerve wracking but you just have to get used to it. This is probably the worst advice but you’ll know for yourself when you perform confidently during placements and that is when all the hard work pays off.

  <div class="message to">Things everyone should do in KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">Every kmit student must atleast once participate in the kmit evening because it’s a great experience Also you are not a kmitian if you have not danced with all your heart on dandiya night.</div>
  <div class="message to">Any fascinating person/people you’ve met at KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">There is no doubt that kmit has the most amazing people and I’m lucky to have made a fascinating group of friends, who are all different in their own way but still connect with each other</div>
  <div class="message to">What will you miss about college life or being at KMIT?</div>
  <div class="message from">This might sound clichéd but it’s true that the best part of college that I would miss are my friends and all those days when we bunked classes to hangout.</div>
  <div class="message to">Best experience at KMIT:</div>
  <div class="message from">Best experience has to be the dandiya night. This is that time of the year when everyone is all dressed up and the entire college is beautifully decorated. The best part of it is how everyone comes together to dance with so much energy, it really pumps up the adrenaline levels.</div>
  <div class="message to">Where do you see KMIT 5 years from now?</div>
  <div class="message from">KMIT has already become very popular for a lot of good reasons and it’s no surprise. I think in the next 5 years kmit will reach greater heights and get more recognition for their teaching approach.</div>
  <div class="message to">5 things that only happen in KMIT</div>
  <div class="message from">
    This is a fun question because there are a lot of things that happen only in kmit<br>
    1. Closing the gates after 10<br>
    2. Finishing School which is an important part of kmit<br>
    3. Freedom to explore our interests<br>
    4. Coffee with kmit<br>
    5. None of these last long :P
  </div>
  <div class="message to"> What is the crowd like in KMIT?</div>
  <div class="message from">As I already mentioned, the people in kmit are amazing and also the crowd is a mix of different kinds of people.</div>
  <div class="message to">If you could switch places with a teacher, who would it be?</div>
  <div class="message from">Every teacher in KMIT is the best in their own way. I’m not sure if all of you know Arshiya ma’am, but if any of you do then you would definitely agree that she is one of the best teachers we could have and it would really mean a lot to me if I could switch places with her as she has a great spirit and is very patient and friendly.</div>
  <div class="message to">Describe KMIT in one word/one sentence</div>
  <div class="message from">A great place to learn and grow as an individual.</div>
  <div class="message to">What did you do for the last time in KMIT?/What is your best last memory?</div>
  <div class="message from">Well I have made a lot of great memories that I will forever cherish.<br>
  In 1st year, for the first time we performed a flash mob and we would bunk classes to practice which was a lot of fun, it also gave me the chance to meet new people who are now my closest friends. So that has to be my best memory in college even though it’s not the best last memory. </div>
  <div class="message to">Favorite year in college</div>
  <div class="message from">1st year was the best year in college.</div>
  <!-- <div class="message to">A funny moment in the class</div>
  <div class="message from">Blahblahblahblahblah</div> -->
  <div class="message to">When have you been punished and for what?</div>
  <div class="message from">Well, I don’t remember being punished maybe that’s because I’m a little nerdy for that.</div>
  <div class="message to">Tell us an incident where you got away with doing something naughty</div>
  <div class="message from">Obviously I wouldn’t reveal that but I could definitely give a hint. I’m sure most of you know that we are supposed to return library books on time or we are asked to pay fine.</div>
